6.1. The case for Docker in Docker

Use case: 
-> When you are running containeraized test suits, so they behave the same on any test suits
-> When you are creating/running applications that need to run other containers from within containeraized apps: platform engineering
-> Emulationg entire platforms

6.2. Creating the container to run containers
2 ways to do this
-> "True" Docker in Docker -> 
Possible issues:
needs cgroup mounting, 
overlay filesystem incompabilities,
-> via UNIX socket -> expose Docker Engine within container through UNIX socket bind mount. All containers are accessible putside of parent container and no cgroup or overlay clashes

Sysbox container runtime project -> available on github
This keeps everything isolated within its own Docker image while still being managed by the Docker engine on your VM.

#bind mapping
sudo docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --entrypoint bash -i -t my-image

curl --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http://anything/containers/json

the above command is the same as the docker inspect

6.3. Installing Docker in the container of containers

#install Docker within a container:
curl -L get.docker.io | bash

#verify that it worked
root@10d2d00c0621:/# docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE      COMMAND   CREATED         STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
10d2d00c0621   my-image   "bash"    4 minutes ago   Up 4 minutes             blissful_heisenberg

#create a new container
docker run --rm my-image

6.4. Limitations of Docker through Docker


ls /app/include/header.txt

docker run --rm -it -v /app/include/header.txt:/header.txt alpine

cat /header.txt

stat /header.txt

stat /app/include/header.txt

-> this created a directory on our machine, instead of a file inside our container

docker volume create temp

#instead of docker run
docker container create -v temp:/tmp alpine


docker cp /app 836f:/tmp/app
root@10d2d00c0621:/# docker cp /app 836f:/tmp/app
Successfully copied 6.66kB to 836f:/tmp/app

docker run --rm -it -v temp:/tmp alpine

cat /tmp/app/include/header.txt
