Docker registry

9.1. Introduction

Sharing containerized apps issues:
-> distribution
-> autheniticity isn't guaranteed
-> tedious to operate - using docker load and docjer run every time

The image registry is a web server that serves container images. Registries use a particular folder structure to make it easy to find images and verify that they are who they claim to be. 
It works seamlessly with Docker pull.
As long as you are logged into the registry you can run 
Docker pull my-app
and Docker will serve that image to you. No more need to use Docker load and Docker save

Docker Hub - the most popular Docker registry

9.2. Creating a simple registry

There are 2 ways to create a registry:
-> run the registry as a container from the official image
-> front the registry with a reverse proxy

#create container
sudo docker run --rm --name registry -p 5000:5000 -d registry:2

sudo docker ps

(base) tea@tea-XPS-13-7390:~/code/Docker$ sudo docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                           COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                                                                            NAMES

#tag the image
sudo docker tag my-image:latest localhost:5000/my-image:latest

#confirm that the image is there
sudo docker images

#push the image
sudo docker push localhost:5000/my-image:latest

#output on the terminal
The push refers to repository [localhost:5000/my-image]

#delete the local copy of the image we pushed
sudo docker rmi localhost:5000/my-image

#remove our local copy of the image
sudo docker rmi my-image -f

sudo docker images

#now that the image has been deleted locally, we will use the registry image we pushed before
sudo docker run --rm localhost:5000/my-image
